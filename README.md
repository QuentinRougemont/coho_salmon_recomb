# coho_salmon_recomb
LDHAT estimates of population effective recombination rates from WHS coho salmon data

estimates were averaged in 250kb and 500kb windows and used in this [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732750v3) to construct jSFS files.  

python script `sliding_window.py` was used to obtained averaged estimates.  

LDhat estimates were obtained using this [pipeline](https://github.com/QuentinRougemont/LDhat_workflow) on WGS data
